Hi all,

Now that we have covered Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning,
it's time for you to apply what you've learned by developing your own RL project.

This project will count for 20% of your final grade.

üìå Project Requirements

You will design and implement an RL pipeline of your choice.
The focus is on understanding the RL process, so a perfect model is not required.
Your project must include:
A well-defined environment (custom or from Gymnasium).
A functioning agent (Q-learning or Deep Q-Learning).
A clear training process (even if the model is not perfectly optimized).
A brief evaluation and reflection on what worked and what didn‚Äôt.

üé§ Presentations & Submission

PRESENT YOUR IDEA
[LunarLander
Object:  Use RL to land the spaceship safely.]
and
YOUR PROGRESS THIS FAR
[Check the report draft.]
Each student will present their project in a 10-minute session
(7 minutes for the presentation + 3 minutes for Q&A).
You can choose your own time slot before the final session on March 27.
Presentations will take place during class time.
Submission: Upload your code and report to the Final RL Project Submission assignment
in Moodle before your presentation.
