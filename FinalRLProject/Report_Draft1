Final Project

I will be using Gymnasium as my environment in this project.
The reinforcement learning algorithm applied is  Deep Q-learning,
because the environment is on continuum, and Q-learning doesn't
scale well with this size of an environment.

First phase of the training process

I'll start wit predicting and printing Q-values for all
4 functions.

PS C:\Path\> .venv\Scripts\activate
(.venv) PS C:\Path\> pip install gymnasium torch numpy matplotlib
(.venv) PS C:\Path\> pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
(.venv) PS C:\Path\> pip install swig
(.venv) PS C:\Path\> pip install "gymnasium[box2d]"

Second phase of the training process
Now I shall save the experiences and use them randomly
to teach the agent.


Third phase of the training process
Epsilon-Greedy Exploration

(Include graphs and insights with matplotlib pyplot)

The Results

I faced the following challenges:

Potential improvements:
